# cintro protocol
Cintro is a protocol whose content is not always "useable" data
or not data at all. In fact, they are introduction of
how to get the real data which another one wants you to
receive. In brief, the cintro protocol intends to make
internet connection a bit more different, you receive
a way to obtain the data(usually the resource address of it)
 instead of directly get the whole data content.
 
This is quite useage when you have a fast way to deliver data
but you only can hold a low speed and/or low quality connection
between you and a remote server, or your network environment
is rigor that each bit of data you send out may under examination,
this may be useful. You can cut off the data you want to send into pieces
and use cintro protocol to tell another one where to find each piece of data,
the whole message may not longer than 100bytes but you can transfer any data
with whatever size you want.

A CDN is quite qualified to complete this task. In China, there is a web supplier called
Aliyun, which is VERY FAST around the world. You can benefit from its global CDN accelerate
service. And since the data may be cut into multi parts, they can be send to different target
in a time. So you see, this protocol relies on other external service to work,
but the service is widely available around the world, so you can almost use the protocol everywhere.

The cintro protocol can be reimplemented to more specified protocols.
This program is just use a protocol like this.
